# You Don't Know JS Yet - 2nd Edition
# Preface

Welcome to the 2nd edition of the widely-acclaimed *You Don't Know JS* (**YDKJS**) book series, *You Don't Know JS **Yet*** (**YDKJSY**).

If you've read any of the 1st edition of the books, you can expect a refreshed approach in these new books, with plenty of new coverage of everything that's changed in JS over the last five years. But what I hope and believe you'll also see is the same committment to respecting JS and digging into what really makes it tick.

The case doesn't really need to be made for why developers need to take JS seriously -- I think JS has already more than proven it's worthy of first class status among the world's programming languages.

But a different, more important case still needs to be made, and the YDKJSY books rise to that challenge.

## Mission

So what's the pressing case?

I unequivocally assert that you as a developer will always be more effective in your work if you understand how your code works, than in the position most developers spend a lot of their time -- focusing on *just* getting it to produce a desired outcome and not realizing *how* that happened.

I've taught more than 5000 developers from teams and companies all over the world, in more than 20 countries and six continents. And what I've seen as a universal theme across all these interactions is that by default, and far too often, what *counts* is generally just the result of the program, not how the program is written or how/why it works.
