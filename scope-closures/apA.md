| :--- |
| Work in progress |

This appendix explores a number of nuances and edges around many of the topics covered in the main text of this book. This is optional, supporting material.

These discussions will be more heavily influenced by my opinions than the main text was, so keep that in mind as you consume and consider what is presented. In a way, this appendix is a bit like a collection of mini-blog posts that expound on the book topics.
