# You Don't Know JS Yet: Getting Started - 2nd Edition
# Chapter 4: The Rest (of the Series)

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Work in progress |

This book surveys most of what you need to be aware of as you *get started* with JS. The goal is to fill in gaps that readers newer to JS might have tripped over in their early encounters with the language. I also hope that we've hinted at enough detail throughout to pique your curiosity to want to dig more into the language.

The rest of the books in this series are where we will unpack all of the language, in far greater detail than we could have done in a few brief chapters here.

Remember to take your time, though. Rather than rushing onto the next book in an attempt to churn through all the books expediently, spend some time going back over the material in this book. Spend some more time looking through code in your current projects, and comparing what you see to what's been discussed here.

When you're ready to move on, this chapter provides a brief roadmap of what to expect from the rest of the book series, and how I suggest you proceed.

## In Order

One of the most common questions I get is, "what order should I read the books?" There's a straightforward answer here, but it also depends.

My suggestion for most readers is, this how best to proceed through this series:

1. Get started on a solid foundation of JS with *Getting Started* (this book).

2. In *Scope & Closures*, learn the first pillar of JS:  lexical scope, how that supports closure, and how the module pattern organizes code.

3. In *Objects & Classes*, focus on the second pillar of JS: how JS's `this` works, how object prototypes support delegation, and how prototypes enable the `class` mechanism for OO-style code organization.

4. In *Types & Grammar*, tackle the third and final pillar of JS: types and type coercion, as well as how JS's syntax and grammar impact the code we write.

5. With the **three pillars** down, *Sync & Async* then explores how flow control can model state change in our programs, both synchronously (right away) and asynchronously (over time).

6. The series concludes with *ES.Next & Beyond*, a forward look at the near- and mid-term future of JS, including a variety of features that are likely coming to your JS programs before too long.

That's the intended order to read this book series.

However, books 2, 3, and 4 can generally be read in any order, depending on which topic you feel most curious about and comfortable exploring first. I don't recommend you skip any of these three books, even if you feel you're already comfortable at quick glance.

Book 5 (*Sync & Async*) is crucial for deeply understanding JS, but if you start digging in and it's too intimidating, this book can be deferred until you're more experienced with the language. The more JS you've written (and struggled with!), the more you'll appreciate this book.

And the final book in the series somewhat stands alone. It can be read at the end, as I suggest, or right after *Getting Started* if you're looking for a shortcut to broaden your radar of what JS is all about. This book will also tend to get more updates going forward in the future, so it will probably need to be re-visited on a regular basis.
