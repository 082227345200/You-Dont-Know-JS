# You Don't Know JS Yet: Getting Started - 2nd Edition
# Chapter 3: Exploring Deeper

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Work in progress |

If you've read Chapters 1 and 2, and taken the time to digest and percolate, you're hopefully starting to *get* JS a little more. If you skipped them (especially Chapter 2), I recommend you re-consider and spend some time with that material.

In Chapter 2, our focus was on syntax, patterns, and behaviors. Here, our attention shifts to some of the lower-level characteristics of JS that underpin virtually every line of code we write.

It should be noted that this material is also not an exhaustive exposition of JS; that's what the rest of the book series is for! Here, or goal is still just to *get started*, and more comfortable with, the *feel* of JS, how it ebbs and flows. This material should begin to answer some of the "Why?" questions that are likely cropping up as you explore JS.
