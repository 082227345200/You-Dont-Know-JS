| Work in progress |

There's no substitute in learning JS other than to just start writing JS. To do that, you need to know how the language works. So, let's get more familiar with its syntax.

This chapter is not an exhaustive reference on every bit of syntax of the JS language. It's also not intended to be an "intro to JS" primer.

Instead, we're just going to survey some of the major topic-areas of the language. Our goal is to get a better *feel* for it, so that we can move forward writing our own programs.

## Files As Programs

Almost every website (web application) you use is comprised of many different JS files (typically with the .js file extension). It's tempting to think of the whole thing (the application) as one program. But JS sees it differently.

In JS, each standalone file is its own separate program.

The reason this matters is primarily around error handling. Since JS treats files as programs, one file may fail (during parse/compile or execution) and that will not necessarily prevent the next file from being processed. Obviously, if your application depends on five .js files, and one of them fails, the overall application will probably only partially operate, at best. It's important to ensure that each file works properly, and that to whatever extent possible, they handle failure in other files as gracefully as possible.

It may surprise you to consider separate .js files as separate JS programs. From the perspective of your usage of an application, it sure seems like one big program. That's because the execution of the application allows these individual *programs* to cooperate and act as one program.

The only way multiple standalone .js files act as a single program is by sharing their state (and access to their public functionality) via the "global scope". They mix together in this global scope namespace, so at runtime they act as as whole.

Since ES6, JS has also supported a module format in addition to the typical standalone JS program format. Modules are also file-based. If a file is loaded via module-loading mechanism such as an `import` statement or a `<script type=module>` tag, all its code is treated as a single module.

Though you wouldn't typically think about a module -- basically, a collection of state and publicly-exposed methods to operate on that state -- as a standalone program, JS does in fact still treat each module separately. Similiar to how "global scope" allows standalone files to mix together at runtime, importing a module into another allows runtime interoperation between them.

Regardless of which code organization pattern (and loading mechanism) is used for a file -- standalone or module -- you should still think of each file as its own (mini) program, which may then cooperate with other (mini) programs to perform the functions of your overall application.

## Values

The most fundamental unit of information in a program is a value. Values are data. They're how the program maintains state. Values come in two forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**.

Values are embedded in our programs using *literals*. For example:

```js
console.log("My name is Kyle.");
// My name is Kyle.
```

In this program, the value `"My name is Kyle."` is a primitive string literal; strings are ordered collections of characters, usually used to represent words and sentences.

I used the double-quote `"` character to *delimit* (surround, separate, define) the string value. But I could have used the single-quote `'` character as well. The choice of which quote character is entirely stylistic. The important thing, for code readability and maintainability sake, is to pick one and to use it consistently throughout the program.

Another option to delimit a string literal is to use the back-tick `` ` `` character. However, this choice is not merely stylistic; there's a behavioral difference as well. Consider:

```js
console.log("My name is ${firstName}.");
// My name is ${firstName}.

console.log('My name is ${firstName}.');
// My name is ${firstName}.

console.log(`My name is ${firstName}.`);
// My name is Kyle.
```

Assuming this program has already defined a variable `firstName` with the string value `"Kyle"`, the `` ` ``-delimited string then resolves the variable expression (indicated with `${ .. }`) to its current value. This is called **interpolation**.

The back-tick `` ` ``-delimited string can be used without including interpolated expressions, but that defeats the whole purpose of that additional syntax.

```js
console.log(`Am I confusing you by omitting interpolotion?`);
// Am I confusing you by omitting interpolation?
```

The better approach is to use `"` or `'` (again, pick one and stick to it!) for strings *unless you need* interpolation; reserve `` ` `` only for strings that will include interpolated expressions.

Other than strings, JS programs often contain other primitive literal values such as booleans and numbers.

```js
while (false) {
    console.log(3.141592);
}
```

`while` represents a loop type, a way to repeat operations *while* its condition is true.

In this case, the loop will never run (and nothing will be printed), because we used the `false` boolean value as the loop conditional. `true` would have resulted in a loop that keeps going forever, so be careful!

The number `3.141592` is, as you may know, an approximation of mathematical PI to the first six digits. Rather than embed such a value, however, you would typically use the predefined `Math.PI` value for that purpose. Another variation on numbers is the `bigint` (big-integer) primitive type, which is used for storing arbitrarily large numbers.

Numbers are most often used in programs for counting steps, such as loop iterations, and accessing information in numeric positions (ie, an array index). Object values represent a collection of any various values. Arrays are a special subset where the collection is ordered, thus the position of an element (index) is numeric.

For example, if there was an array called `names`, we could access the element in the second position like this:

```js
console.log(`My name is ${ names[1] }.`);
// My name is Kyle.
```

We used `1` for the element in the second position, instead of `2`, because like in most programming languages, JS array indices are 0-based (`0` is the first position).

By contrast, regular objects are unordered and keyed collections of values; in other words, you access the element by a string location name (aka "key" or "property") rather than by its numeric position (as with arrays). For example:

```js
console.log(`My name is ${ name.first }.`);
```

Here, `name` represents an object, and `first` represents the name of a location of information in that object (value collection). Another syntax option that accesses information in an object by its property/key uses the square-brackets `[ ]`, such as  `name["first"]`.

In addition to strings, numbers, and booleans, two other *primitive* values in JS programs are `null` and `undefined`. While there are differences between them (some historic and some contemporary), for the most part both values serve the purpose of indicating *emptiness* (or absence) of a value.

Many developers prefer to treat them both consistently in this fashion, which is to say that the values are assumed to be indistinguishable. If care is taken, this is often possible. However, it's safest and best to use only `undefined` as the single empty value, even though `null` seems attractive in that it's shorter to type!

```js
while (value != undefined) {
    console.log("Still got something!");
}
```

The final primitive value to be aware of is a symbol, which is a special-purpose value that behaves as a hidden unguessable value. Symbols are almost exclusively used as special keys on objects.

```js
hitchhikersGuide[ Symbol("meaning of life") ];
// 42
```

## Variables

To be explicit about something that may not have been obvious in the previous section: in JS programs, values can either appear as literal values (as many of the above examples illustrate), or they can be held in variables; think of variables as just containers for values.

Variables have to be declared (created) to be used. There are various syntax forms that declare variables (aka, "identifiers"), and each form has different implied behaviors.

For example, consider the `var` statement:

```js
var name = "Kyle";
var age;
```

The `var` keyword declares a variable to be used in that part of the program, and optionally allows an initial assignment of a value.

Another similar keyword is `let`:

```js
let name = "Kyle";
let age;
```

The `let` keyword has some differences to `var`, with the most obvious being that `let` allows a more limited access to the variable than `var`. This is called "block scoping" as opposed to regular or function scoping.

Consider:

```js
var adult = true;

if (adult) {
    var name = "Kyle";
    let age = 39;
    console.log("Shhh, this is a secret!");
}

console.log(name);
// Kyle

console.log(age);
// Error!
```

The attempt to access `age` outside of the `if` statement results in an error, because `age` was block-scoped to the `if`, whereas `name` was not.

Block-scoping is very useful for limiting how widespread variable declarations are in our programs, which helps prevent accidental overlap of their names.

But `var` is still useful in that it communicates "this variable will be seen by a wider scope". Both declaration forms can be appropriate in any given part of a program, depending on the circumstances.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| It's very common to suggest that `var` should be avoided in favor of `let` (or `const`!), generally because of perceived confusion over how the scoping behavior of `var` has worked since the beginning of JS. I believe this to be overly restrictive advice and ultimately unhelpful. It's assuming you are unable to learn and use a feature properly in combination with other features. I belive you *can* and *should* learn any features available, and use them where appropriate! |

A third declaration form is `const`. It's like `let` but has an additional limitation that it must be given a value at the moment it's declared, and cannot be re-assigned a different value later.

Consider:

```js
const myBirthday = true;
let age = 39;

if (myBirthday) {
    age = age + 1;    // OK!
    myBirthday = false;  // Error!
}
```

The `myBirthday` constant is not allowed to be re-assigned.

`const` declared variables are not "unchangeable", they just cannot be re-assigned. It's ill-advised to use `const` with object values, because those values can still be changed even though the variable can't be re-assigned. This leads to potential confusion down the line, so I think it's wise to avoid situations like:

```js
const actors = [ "Morgan Freeman", "Jennifer Anniston" ];

actors[2] = "Tom Cruise";   // OK :(

actors = [];                // Error!
```

The best semantic use of a `const` is when you have a simple primitive value that you want to give a useful name to, such as using `myBirthday` instead of `true`. This makes programs easier to read.

| TIP: |
| :--- |
| If you stick to using `const` only with primitive values, you never have the confusion of the difference between re-assignment (not allowed) and mutation (allowed)! That's the safest and best way to use `const`. |

Besides `var` / `let` / `const`, there are other syntactic forms that declare identifiers (variables) in various scopes. For example:

```js
function hello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}.`);
}

hello("Kyle");
// Hello, Kyle.
```

Here, the identifier `hello` is created in the outer scope, and it's also automatically associated so that it references the function. But the named parameter `name` is created only inside the function, and thus is only accessible inside that function's scope.

Both `hello` and `name` act generally as if they were declared with `var`.

Another syntax that declares a variable is the `catch` clause of a `try..catch` statement:

```js
try {
    someError();
}
catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
}
```

The `err` is a block-scoped variable that exists only inside the `catch` clause, as if it had been declared with `let`.

## Functions

The word "function" has a variety of meanings in programming. For example, in the world of Functional Programming, "function" has a precise mathematical definition and implies a strict set of rules to abide by.

In JS, we should consider "function" to take the broader meaning of "procedure": a collection of statements that can be invoked one or more times, may be provided some inputs, and may give back one or more outputs.

In the good ol' days of JS, there was just one way to define a function:

```js
function awesomeFunction(coolThings) {
    // ..
    return amazingStuff;
}
```

This is called a function declaration because it appears as a statement by itself, not as an expression that's part of another statement. The association between the identifier `awesomeFunction` and the function value happens immediately during the compile phase of the code, before that code is executed.

By contrast, a function expression can be defined like this:

```js
// let awesomeFunction = ..
// const awesomeFunction = ..
var awesomeFunction = function(coolThings) {
    // ..
    return amazingStuff;
};
```

This function is an expression that is assigned to the variable `awesomeFunction`. Different from the function declaration form, a function expression is not associated with its identifier until that statement during runtime.

The function expression above is referred to as an *anonymous function expression*, since it has no name identifier between the `function` keyword and the `(..)` parameter list. This point confuses many JS developers because as of ES6, JS performs a "name inference" on an anonymous function:

```js
awesomeFunction.name;
// "awesomeFunction"
```

The `name` property of a function will reveal either its directly given name (in the case of a declaration) or its inferred name in the case of an anonymous function expression. That value is generally used by developer tools when inspecting a function value or when reporting an error stack trace.

So even an anonymous function expression *might* get a name. However, name inference only happens in limited cases such as when the function expression is assigned (with `=`). If you pass a function expression as an argument to a function call, for example, no name inference occurs, the `name` property will be an empty string, and the developer console will usually report "(anonymous function)".

Even if a name is inferred, **it's still an anonymous function.** Why? Because the inferred name is a metadata string value, not an available identifier to refer to the function. An anonymous function doesn't have an identifier to use to refer to itself from inside itself -- for recursion, event unbinding, etc.

Compare the anonymous function expression form to:

```js
// let awesomeFunction = ..
// const awesomeFunction = ..
var awesomeFunction = function someName(coolThings) {
    // ..
    return amazingStuff;
};

awesomeFunction.name;
// "someName"
```

This function expression is a *named function expression*, since the identifier `someName` is directly associated with the function expression at compile time; the association with the identifier `awesomeFunction` still doesn't happen until runtime at the time of that statement. Those two identifiers don't have to match; sometimes it makes sense to have them be different, othertimes it's better to have them be the same.

Notice also that the explicit function name, the identifier `someName`, takes precedence when assignging a *name* for the `name` property.

Should function expressions be named or anonymous? Opinions vary widely on this. Most developers tend to be unconcerned with using anonymous functions. They're shorter, and unquestionably more common in the broad sphere of JS code out there.

| MY TAKE: |
| :--- |
| If a function exists in your program, it has a purpose; otherwise, take it out! If it has a purpose, it has a natural name that describes that purpose. If it has a name, you the code author should include that name in the code, so that the reader does not have to infer that name from reading and mentally executing that function's source code. Even a trivial function body like `x * 2` has to be read to infer a name like "double" or "multBy2"; that brief extra mental work is unnecessary when you could just take a second to name the function "double" or "multBy2" *once*, saving the reader that repeated mental work every time it's read in the future. |

There are, regretably in some respects, many other function definition forms in JS in 2019.

Here are some more declaration forms:

```js
// generator function declaration
function *two() { .. }

// async function declaration
async function three() { .. }

// async generator function declaration
async function *four() { .. }

// named function export declaration (ES6 modules)
export function five() { .. }
```

And here are some more of the (many!) function expression forms:

```js
// IIFE
(function(){ .. })();
(function namedIIFE(){ .. })();

// asynchronous IIFE
(async function(){ .. })();
(async function namedAIIFE(){ .. })();

// arrow function expressions
var f;
f = () => 42;
f = x => x * 2;
f = (x) => x * 2;
f = (x,y) => x * y;
f = x => ({ x: x * 2 });
f = x => { return x * 2; };
f = async x => {
    var y = await doSomethingAsync(x);
    return y * 2;
};
someOperation( x => x * 2 );
// ..
```

Keep in mind that arrow function expressions are **syntactically anonymous**, meaning the syntax doesn't provide a way to provide a direct name identifier for the function. The function expression may get an inferred name, but only if it's one of the assignment forms, not in the (more common!) form of being passed as a function call argument (as in the last line of the snippet).

Functions can also be specified in class definitions and object literal definitions. They're typically referred to as "methods" when in these forms, though in JS this term doesn't have much observable difference over "function".

```js
class SomethingKindaGreat {
    coolMethod() { .. }   // look, no commas!
    boringMethod() { .. }
}

var EntirelyDifferent = {
    coolMethod() { .. },   // don't forget the comma!
    boringMethod() { .. },

    // old-school (anonymous) function expression
    oldSchool: function() { .. }
};
```

Phew! That's a lot of different ways to define functions.

There's no simple shortcut path here, you just have to get really used to all the function forms so you can recognize them in existing code and use them appropriately in the code you write. Study them closely and practice!
